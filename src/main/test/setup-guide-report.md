Introduction

This Test Plan outlines the strategy and approach for testing the Java-based services within the CyberDashboard application, ensuring compliance with ISTQB (International Software Testing Qualifications Board) standards and aligning with Fortune 10 companies’ best practices. The primary goal is to ensure the quality, reliability, and security of the application before its release.

Test Objectives
•	Verify Functionality: Ensure all services perform their intended functions correctly.
•	Ensure Security: Validate that security measures are robust and protect against vulnerabilities.
•	Assess Performance: Confirm that services meet performance benchmarks under expected loads.
•	Validate Compliance: Ensure adherence to ISTQB standards and Fortune 10 technology requirements.
•	Enhance User Experience: Guarantee that the application is user-friendly and meets user expectations.

Test Approach

Testing Levels
1.	Unit Testing:
•	Utilize JUnit and Mockito frameworks.
•	Mock dependencies to isolate services.
•	Validate business logic and method behaviors.
2.	Integration Testing:
•	Test interactions between services and repositories.
•	Use in-memory databases like H2 for testing.
•	Validate transaction management and data persistence.
3.	Security Testing:
•	Perform vulnerability assessments.
•	Test role-based access controls.
•	Validate token generation and expiration mechanisms.
4.	Performance Testing:
•	Use tools like JMeter to simulate load.
•	Assess response times and throughput under stress.
5.	Regression Testing:
•	Re-run existing test cases after code changes.
•	Ensure new changes do not break existing functionalities.
6.	User Acceptance Testing (UAT):
•	Engage end-users to validate the application’s usability and functionality.
•	Gather feedback for improvements.

Test Design Techniques
•	Black Box Testing: Focus on inputs and expected outputs without internal code knowledge.
•	White Box Testing: Analyze internal code structures and logic.
•	Boundary Value Analysis: Test edge cases and boundary conditions.
•	Equivalence Partitioning: Reduce test cases by partitioning inputs into equivalent classes.
•	Error Guessing: Intuitively identify potential error-prone areas based on experience.

Script Overview
•	Creates Test Directories: Organizes tests into Unit, Integration, Security, and Performance folders.
•	Generates Test Files: Inserts JUnit test stubs into respective test files.
•	Ensures Compliance: Aligns with ISTQB best practices for test organization.

Usage Instructions
1.	Save the Script: Save the following script as setup_tests.sh in your project root directory.
2.	Make Executable: Run chmod +x setup_tests.sh to make the script executable.
3.	Execute the Script: Run ./setup_tests.sh to generate the test folder structure and test files.

Explanation of the Script
1.	Directory Structure:
•	tests/
•	unit/service/: Contains unit tests for each service.
•	integration/service/: Contains integration tests for each service.
•	security/service/: Contains security tests for each service.
•	performance/service/: Contains performance tests for each service.
2.	Test File Generation:
•	For each service, the script generates corresponding test classes in each testing category.
•	Unit Tests: Utilize JUnit and Mockito for mocking dependencies.
•	Integration Tests: Use Spring Boot’s testing capabilities for context loading and bean interactions.
•	Security Tests: Placeholder for security-related test cases.
•	Performance Tests: Placeholder for performance-related test cases.
3.	Customization:
•	TODOs: Each generated test file contains TODO comments indicating where to implement specific test cases.
•	Package Naming: Adjust package names (orsk.compli.tests.*) as per your project’s structure.
4.	Idempotency:
•	The script checks if a test file already exists before creating it to prevent overwriting existing tests.
5.	Execution Feedback:
•	Provides console output indicating the creation status of each test file and directory.

Example Output

Upon executing the script, the following folder structure and test files will be generated:

tests/
├── unit/
│   └── service/
│       ├── VulnerabilityJpaServiceTest.java
│       ├── CountryJpaServiceTest.java
│       └── ... (other service tests)
├── integration/
│   └── service/
│       ├── VulnerabilityJpaServiceIntegrationTest.java
│       ├── CountryJpaServiceIntegrationTest.java
│       └── ... (other service integration tests)
├── security/
│   └── service/
│       ├── VulnerabilityJpaServiceSecurityTest.java
│       ├── CountryJpaServiceSecurityTest.java
│       └── ... (other service security tests)
└── performance/
└── service/
├── VulnerabilityJpaServicePerformanceTest.java
├── CountryJpaServicePerformanceTest.java
└── ... (other service performance tests)

Each test file will contain a basic JUnit test class structure with placeholders for actual test implementations.

Next Steps
1.	Implement Test Cases: Replace TODO comments with actual test logic based on the service’s functionality.
2.	Integrate with CI/CD: Incorporate the tests into your Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipelines to ensure automated testing.
3.	Expand Test Coverage: As new features are added, update the test plan and scripts accordingly to maintain comprehensive coverage.
4.	Regular Reviews: Periodically review and update the test plan to adapt to evolving project requirements and industry standards.

Note: This test plan and script serve as a foundational framework. Depending on project complexity and specific requirements, further customization and elaboration may be necessary to achieve optimal testing effectiveness.
