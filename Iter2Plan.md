-- Note: Ensure that partitioning aligns with query patterns (e.g., time-based)
CREATE TABLE audit_logs (
    log_id BIGINT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL, -- Reference to users table
    action VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, -- e.g., INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
    target_type_id BIGINT UNSIGNED, -- Reference to entity_types table
    target_id BIGINT UNSIGNED,
    action_description TEXT, -- Detailed Description of the Action
    ip_address VARCHAR(45), -- To store IPv6 Addresses
    user_agent VARCHAR(255),
    timestamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(user_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (target_type_id) REFERENCES entity_types(entity_type_id) ON DELETE SET NULL
) ENGINE=InnoDB
PARTITION BY RANGE (YEAR(timestamp)) (
    PARTITION p2023 VALUES LESS THAN (2024),
    PARTITION p2024 VALUES LESS THAN (2025),
    PARTITION p_future VALUES LESS THAN MAXVALUE
);

-- Example: Creating Summary Tables for Materialized Views (Emulated)

    last_updated DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (type_id) REFERENCES indicator_types(type_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
) ENGINE=InnoDB;

-- Scheduled Event to Update indicators_summary
CREATE EVENT IF NOT EXISTS update_indicators_summary
ON SCHEDULE EVERY 1 HOUR
DO
    REPLACE INTO indicators_summary (type_id, indicator_count, last_updated)
    SELECT type_id, COUNT(*), NOW()
    FROM indicators
    GROUP BY type_id;

Key Enhancements:
	1.	Comprehensive Indexing: Implemented indexes on frequently queried columns across all tables to optimize query performance, crucial for large-scale CTI operations.
	2.	Table Partitioning: Applied time-based partitioning to high-volume tables like audit_logs to enhance performance and manageability. Partitioning should align with common query patterns (e.g., temporal queries).
	3.	Materialized Views Emulation: Created summary tables (e.g., indicators_summary) and scheduled events to emulate materialized views, reducing the computational overhead of complex joins and aggregations in real-time queries.
	4.	Caching Mechanisms: Although not implemented in SQL, consider integrating caching layers (e.g., Redis, Memcached) at the application level to cache frequently accessed data, further enhancing performance.

2.6. Audit Logging

Comprehensive audit logs are essential for monitoring, compliance, and incident response. Implementing audit logging at the application layer is more scalable and flexible than using database triggers.

-- Enhanced Audit Logs Table
CREATE TABLE audit_logs (
    log_id BIGINT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL, -- Reference to users table
    action VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, -- e.g., CREATE_INDICATOR, UPDATE_INCIDENT
    target_entity_id BIGINT UNSIGNED, -- ID of the target entity
    target_entity_type_id BIGINT UNSIGNED, -- Reference to entity_types table
    action_description TEXT, -- Detailed Description of the Action
    ip_address VARCHAR(45), -- To store IPv6 Addresses
    user_agent VARCHAR(255),
    timestamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(user_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (target_entity_type_id) REFERENCES entity_types(entity_type_id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
    INDEX idx_audit_logs_user_id (user_id),
    INDEX idx_audit_logs_target (target_entity_id, target_entity_type_id)
) ENGINE=InnoDB;

-- Application-Level Handling:
-- Instead of using triggers, ensure that the application layer inserts appropriate records into audit_logs upon critical actions.

Key Enhancements:
	1.	Application-Level Audit Logging: Shifting audit logging responsibilities to the application layer allows for more detailed and context-rich logs, including capturing ip_address and user_agent dynamically.
	2.	Granular Action Tracking: The action field is standardized (e.g., CREATE_INDICATOR, UPDATE_INCIDENT), enabling consistent tracking and querying of user actions.
	3.	Indexing for Performance: Added indexes on user_id and target entity references to facilitate efficient querying of audit logs based on users or specific entities.
